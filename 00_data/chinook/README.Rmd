## About

The Chinook database consists of 11 tables that represent 

- `Employee` table stores employees data such as employee id, last name, first name, etc. It also has a field named `ReportsTo` to specify who reports to whom.

- `Customer` table stores customers data.

- `Invoice` & `InvoiceLine` tables: these two tables store invoice data. The `Invoice` table stores invoice header data and the `InvoiceLine` table stores the invoice line items data.

- `Artist` table stores artists data. It is a simple table that contains only artist id and name.

- `Album` table stores data about a list of tracks. Each album belongs to one artist. However, one artist may have multiple albums.

- `MediaType` table stores media types such as MPEG audio file, ACC audio file, etc.

- `Genre` table stores music types such as rock, jazz, metal, etc.

- `Track` table store the data of songs. Each track belongs to one album.

- `Playlist` & `PlaylistTrack` tables: `Playlist` table store data about playlists. Each playlist contains a list of tracks. Each track may belong to multiple playlists. The relationship between the `Playlist` table and `Track` table is many-to-many. The `PlaylistTrack` table is used to reflect this relationship.
