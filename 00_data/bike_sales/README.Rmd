- `bikeshops` table which includes customers that the bicycle manufacturer has sold to.

- `orderlines` table which includes transactional data such as order ID, order line, date, customer, product, and quantity sold.

dir_info("./data_raw") %>%
    filter(str_detect(path, "xlsx")) %>%
    pull(path) %>%
    map(read_xlsx) %>%
    set_names(c("bikes", "bikeshops", "orderlines"))
